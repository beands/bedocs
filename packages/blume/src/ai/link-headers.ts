/**
 * The homepage `Link` response header (RFC 8288) — agent discovery for the
 * machine-readable surface BeDocs already publishes. Agents probing a site read
 * this header off `GET /` to find the resources without scraping HTML:
 * `agent-readability.json` and `llms.txt` as `rel="describedby"`, and the
 * homepage's raw-Markdown mirror as `rel="alternate"` (only when the home
 * route is a content page — a user landing page has no mirror). Both rel
 * values are IANA-registered, which agent-readiness checkers require.
 *
 * The header is homepage-only by design: the root response is what agents
 * probe, and `agent-readability.json` indexes the rest of the surface (the
 * per-route Markdown pattern, MCP, feeds) far better than per-page headers
 * could. An agent that enters on a deep page (a search result, a shared link)
 * never sees this header at all — that path is covered in the HTML instead:
 * every page's `<head>` carries the same `describedby` links plus its own
 * Markdown mirror as an `alternate` (see `RootLayout.astro`), which also
 * reaches hosts where Blume can't set response headers. Targets are
 * root-relative under `deployment.base` — RFC 8288 resolves them against the
 * request URL. Returns null when nothing is advertisable.
